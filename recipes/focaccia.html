<h3>Description</h3>
<div class="section">
    <p>Few things smell better than the sweet aroma of yeast bread baking in the oven.  Add to that the fragrance of rosemary and it’s pretty much the closest thing to heaven.

        Focaccia.  Rustic and romantic, this prized bread from northwestern Italy is the most perfect combination of crispy, fluffy, chewy and moist that I can think of.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<div class="section">
<ol>
    <li>Combine the yeast, water and sugar in a bowl and let it sit in a warm place for about 15 minutes until frothy.</li>
    <li>In a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour, salt, olive oil and yeast mixture on low speed until the dough comes together, then increase to medium speed and continue to knead for another 5-7 minutes until the texture becomes smooth and soft. If the dough is too sticky add a little more flour.</li>
    <li>Remove the dough, spray the mixer bowl with olive oil, return the dough, cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap and put it in a warm, draft-free place to rise for at least 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
    <li>Coat a standard 15 1/2 x 10 ½-inch rimmed sheet pan with the 1/4 cup of olive oil. Place the dough on the sheet pan, pulling and pressing it with your hands it to spread it across to fit the size of the pan. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let the dough rise for another 60 minutes or until doubled in size. Towards the end, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.</li>
    <li>Use your fingertips to press lots of deep dimples into the dough then drizzle generously with olive oil, letting the oil pool in the dimples. Place the olives throughout some of the dimples, sprinkle generously with rosemary leaves and a few rosemary sprig tips and some coarse salt.</li>
    <li>Bake on the middle shelf for 15-20 minutes or until the top is light golden brown. Let it cool for a couple of minutes before slicing into squares. Best served immediately while the crust is still warm and crispy.</li>
